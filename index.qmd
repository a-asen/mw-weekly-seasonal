Everyone is exposed to seasonal variation in sunlight. For most people in the world, sunrise and sunset does not change that much, but for people living further from the equator, the changes in sunrise and sunset can be drastic. Indeed, Tromsø in Northern Norway is uniquely situated above the Arctic circle (69 longitude) and experience complete darkness (no sunrise) during winter, and no darkness (no sunset) during summer.
